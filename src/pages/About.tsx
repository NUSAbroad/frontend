        We started NUSAbroad to help improve the exchange application experience
        for students. Anyone who has prepared exchange applications in the past
        would know that it is a <b>slow, tedious and messy</b> process.
      </StyledBody1>
      <StyledBody1>
        Our goal was to make the experience <b>fast, easy and organised</b>{" "}
        instead. We sought to do this by simplifying the process of finding
        information on partner universities and their past approved mappings, as
        well as provide a built-in tool for preparing your study plan.
